# Bioinfo_COVID-19_Biomarkers
This project identifies potential COVID-19 biomarker genes through differential gene expression analysis. It includes scripts for data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization of gene expression and p-value correlations, aiming to highlight significant genes as potential markers for COVID-19 diagnostics and research.
