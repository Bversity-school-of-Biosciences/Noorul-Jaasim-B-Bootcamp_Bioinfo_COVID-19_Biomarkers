# Bioinfo_COVID-19_Biomarkers_Project
**COVID-19 Biomarker Identification Project**
This repository contains the code and resources for identifying potential biomarker genes associated with COVID-19 through differential gene expression analysis. The project aims to highlight significant genes that may serve as diagnostic or therapeutic markers, supporting further research into COVID-19 biology.
Project Overview

Through analysis of gene expression data, this project identifies genes with significant differential expression in response to COVID-19. Statistical and visualization methods are used to highlight genes with both high fold changes and low p-values, which may represent strong biomarker candidates.
Key Objectives
Identify genes with significant differential expression in COVID-19 samples.
Determine potential biomarkers based on fold change and statistical significance.
Visualise gene expression levels and correlation between fold change and p-values.

Repository Contents
